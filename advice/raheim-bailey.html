            <h4>Don't Take Breaks</h4>
            <p>In my opinion the worst thing you can do when trying to learn coding (seriously)
                is to just dip your toes into the water. Even worse is starting then taking a big break just when you get
                started going. Rule number #1 in my books.<br> <strong>CODE EVERYDAY</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>Don't Let Confusion Stop You</h4>

            <p>Rule #2, you're going to be confused.
                This is just apart of the game. Don't let the fear of the unknown stop you from getting down and dirty with the code.
               Often times when you're confused and your code just isnt working right you'll start to think "Maybe this isnt for me".
               <strong>WRONG</strong>  For most people coding doesnt come naturally, me included. Training your brain to think like a developer 
               is defintiely a process and it will take some time
               Keep on coding, let your brain readjust ad develop the strucutres needed to start to think like a computer. Move at your own pace and don't be afraid.
